# regression_boston_housing

This dataset is available in the scikit. So, the data can be loaded directly from the scikit dataset.
Here, I have tried to implement most of the supervised regression model to train the data. I have also tried to implement unsupervised models to this dataset; initially, converting the output to categorical values. This dataset is widely used for practicing, and there are plenty of examples of it in many books and online as well. But, this is little different in a way that I have tried to implement everything in a single file.
